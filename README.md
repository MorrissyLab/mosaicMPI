**mosaicMPI** is a Python package for enabling mosaic integration of bulk, single-cell, and spatial expression data through program-level integration. Programs are first discovered using unsupervised deconvolution (consensus non-negative matrix factorization, cNMF) across multiple ranks separately for each dataset. A flexible network-based approach groups similar programs together across resolutions and datasets. Program communities are then interpreted using sample/cell metadata and gene set analyses. Integrative program communities enable metadata transfer across datasets.

## âš¡Main Features

Here are just a few of the things that `mosaicMPI` does well:

- Identifies interpretable, non-negative programs at multiple resolutions
- Mosaic integration does not require subsetting features/genes to
  intersection or highly-variable subset
- Multi-omics integration without shared sample IDs
- Incremental integration (adding datasets one at a time) since
  deconvolution is performed independently on each dataset
- High performance integration of datasets with mismatched features
  (eg. Microarray, RNA-Seq, Proteomics) or sparsity (eg. single-cell vs. bulk)
- Metadata transfer across datasets

`mosaicMPI` has two interfaces:
- command-line interface (CLI) with a standardized workflow for rapid data exploration and integration
- python API for greatest flexibility and extensibility

## ðŸ”§ Install

### ðŸ§° System Requirements

- Compatible with OS X, Windows and Linux systems
- Memory usage depends on size and number of datasets

### âœ¨ Latest Release
Install the package with `conda`:
```bash

# create an environment called 'mosaicenv' and install
conda create -n mosaicenv -c conda-forge mosaicmpi
conda activate mosaicenv
```

Some analyses require packages from other channels to be installed in the same environment:

- [`PyComplexHeatmap`](https://github.com/DingWB/PyComplexHeatmap):

```bash
pip install PyComplexHeatmap
```

- [`g:Profiler`](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/apis)

```bash
conda install -c bioconda gprofiler-official
```

- [`GSEApy`](https://github.com/zqfang/GSEApy):

```bash
# if you have conda (MacOS_x86-64 and Linux only)
conda install -c bioconda gseapy
# Windows and macOS (Apple Silicon)
pip install gseapy
```
